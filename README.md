# RoboticArm
Artificial Robotic Arm to lift the objects: 
The main objective of this project is to design an application for robotics in such a way that the robot can detect the given object by using its co-ordinate and real-time image data and move towards it and then it will grasp that object using itâ€™s artificial hand and lift it for over 5 seconds and then place that object again to 
the co-ordinates from where he picked. We use TensorFlow and pybullet to implement it and we pass various images data to our algorithm to train it to detect the object
